# Algorithms

A Set Of Algorithms that I have been experimenting with in my free time

## Description

These algorithms are included

* Sequence Insert
  - A Program that tests the insertion time in data structures
* Week10/Main
  - Testing recrusion in programming
* Week11/BST
  - Implementation of a Binary Search Tree with methods for insertion, search, height calculation, and AVL check.
* Week15/Exponentiation
  - Recursive implementation of exponentiation with a main method to test the function.
* Week16/TwosThreesFives
  - Program to calculate the product of the factors 2, 3, and 5 of a given number.
* Week18/MemoFib
  - Implementation of Fibonacci sequence using memoization to optimize performance.
* Week18/NQueens
  - Recursive solution for the N-Queens problem.
* Week18/SubSet
  - Program to determine if a subset of integers sums up to a given value.

There are many programs available so feel free to explore these solutions
